# Breast_cancer_detection:
The system detects whether it is a Benign tumor (normal) or
Malignant tumor (cancer causing). I have used logistic regression to train the dataset
and predict whether it is benign /malignant tumor. I have learnt about basics of cancer,
preprocessing, model evaluation, building of the predictive system, etc.
